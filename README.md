# dayplanner
for this challege i will be making an itneractive dayplanner app
i will make sure the current day is displayed
present timeblocks with standard working hours displayed
color code each timeblock to indicate if it is past present or future
use local storage to sotre data that is inputed in to the planner
and when the page is refreshed the events posted persist
